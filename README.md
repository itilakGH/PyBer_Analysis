# PyBer_Analysis
Analyzing the data of a ride-sharing company dataset
## Challenge
In this challenge, we analyzed  ride sharing data using Jupyter notebook and Matplotlit and Pandas
Resources used (in the folder "Resources2"):
  1. city_data.csv
  2. ride_data.csv

The visualizations were saved in a folder called 'analysis'

Summary:
  1. The DataFrame -
    Total rides in the Urban areas is the largest with the most drivers and revenue.  However, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is the lowest for Urban rides.  Rural area rides had the lowest total rides and the highest Average fare per ride and Average fare per Driver. From the data table, we can conclude that the urban rider takes many small rides comapred wtih the rural counterpart.

  2. The Line Graph -
   The visualization on the total fare by City types shows that all city types show a peak in total fare in the third week of April.  The weekly trend is similar across all the city types other than the a few exceptions.
